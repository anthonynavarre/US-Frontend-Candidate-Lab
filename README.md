## CP+B Candidate Lab

Hello and thank you for taking the time to work on this lab!

This lab is an opportunity for us to have a conversation about practices, conventions, and workflow.
It will also help us better understand you as a developer. 
Please use this as a way to communicate through your craft.


# Setup

1. Fork this repo and clone to your computer
2. Setup the project in your preferred IDE
3. View index.html in the browser (/www)
4. Open the psd file in /psd (/psd)


# Development

* Improve semantic structure and content of the HTML
* Incorporate missing design elements (per psd)
* Create an RSVP message onClick of 'Yes' or 'No':
  ** Provide feedback to the user with confirmation of their choice
  ** Design, behavior, and messaging are up to you
  ** Plug-ins, libraries, and frameworks are permitted
* Modify anything and everything you think should be different/improved. Document the reasoning for your changes in the Notes section.


# Workflow

Please make atomic commits (commit often) as you progress. 
Be sure to provide useful commit messages to illustrate milestones and workflow.
Submit a pull request when you are finished and satisfied with your work.

# Notes

Use this area to communicate any thought processes, ideas, or challenges you encountered.

* Responsive layout would be great - chose to focus on JS refactors
  instead to highlight OOP. In general, I'm not as practiced at
  responsive CSS, but on a real project I would have spent the time to
  get that right especially since it's likely that a communication like
  this one would likely have a high interaction rate on mobile devices.
* Would be nice to alter the provided wood grain background image to
  allow for a repeating background - especially if somehow able to apply
  the "Cicada" technique described here:
  http://designfestival.com/the-cicada-principle-and-why-it-matters-to-web-designers/
  Alas, Photoshop is not my strong suit - I would opt to leave the image
  prep in more capable hands and possibly experiment with a few prime
  number mixes to see which looked most natural / organic.
* #invitation background texture PSD shows gradients. Opting for
  repeating background image for now instead in favor of scaling size of
  content area.
* Chose to use PT Sans instead of pricy Helvetica Neue for web fonts -
  would want to vet this decision with designer or, preferably, go with
  Helvetica Neue from Fonts.com and make this font styling consistent
  throughout campaign.
* Considered font stack incl. Lucida Handwriting & Brush Script MT for
  handwritten font, but those don't scale well at 12px - favored
  legibility over style and went with a sans-serif fallback.
  CourtneyDorkling font only available (easily) as a .ttf - might need
  to track down .woff, .eot & .svg file types or go with an image
  fallback.
